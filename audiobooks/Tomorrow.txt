There is no tomorrow|Yoon Dongju|People kept talking about tomorrow;
So I asked them what it is.
They told me that tomorrow will be
When night is gone and dawn comes.
Anxiously waiting for a new day,
I slept through the night and 
woke up to learn
that tomorrow was no more
It was another today.
Friends,
There is no such a thing
As tomorrow.
